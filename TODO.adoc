== Overview

=== Architecture

Server connects to the neovim instance and translates msgpack to websockets. So each notification
from NeoVim will be read, and forwarded as a websocket message.

CAUTION: Unfortunately AFAICT msgpack cannot be just passed through, you have to decode everything
to get to the end of the message.

TODO: see how firenvim does it. They open up a websocket server directly from inside
neovim, so perhaps they can attach callbacks directly via lua?

The client receives the notifications and builds up some state that is rendered to the DOM
via every flush.

=== Challenges

To win this game we have to be efficient at every step. It will be interesting to find the
fast paths in DOM rendering, and what data structures will be useful to translate the neovim
cells into "runs" that can be styles with CSS.
