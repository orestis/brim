== TODO

* Correct cursor based on mode
* Composed emoji (seems like neovim bug?)
* OS paste support and other stuff like this
* Mouse support at least for resizing 
* Don't ever lose focus of input box
* Even better performance (measure what's the delay)
* Debug console to show rendering delay

== Next steps

* Multigrid support
* Better scroll performance for multigrid if assumption stands?
* External cmdline
* External msges
* External popup menu
* External tabline
* What is the ui-hl state? Could we use it to map to css classes for some stuff?
* Morphdom or other approaches to mutate the dom?
